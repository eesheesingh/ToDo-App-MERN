# TODO App with MERN Stack
Overview
The TODO app is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) that allows users to efficiently manage and organize their tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and tracking tasks, helping users stay organized and productive.

## Features
Task Management: Users can create new tasks, update existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
Task Filtering and Sorting: Users can filter tasks based on different criteria such as completion status, due date, or priority, enabling efficient task organization.
User Authentication: The app supports user authentication, allowing users to create accounts, log in securely, and ensure their tasks are protected.
Responsive Design: The app is designed with a responsive layout, providing a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
Technology Stack

## The TODO app is built using the following technologies:

- Frontend (React.js): The frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It handles the user interface, interaction, and state management of the TODO app. Users can view their tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks.

- Backend (Node.js and Express.js): The backend is developed using Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime, and Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. It provides the necessary APIs and routes to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks. It interacts with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve task data.

- Database (MongoDB): MongoDB is a NoSQL database used for storing task data. It offers flexibility and scalability, allowing users to store and retrieve task information efficiently. The app interacts with the MongoDB database through the Mongoose library, which provides an object data modeling (ODM) layer for MongoDB.
